# agentdock-protocol

Shared contracts used by AgentDock and NexusDock.

The repository intentionally has two logical layers:

- the root `protocol` package owns only the AgentDock ↔ NexusDock Bridge wire protocol: envelopes, Hello capabilities, operations, and MCP App resource identities/contracts;
- `mcpcontract` owns only the canonical model-facing MCP contracts shared by the two entrypoints: input/output schemas, annotations, and bounded behavior vectors.

Neither package owns AgentDock runtime behavior, NexusDock stores, renderer HTML, Recall persistence, Workflow persistence, or HTTP handlers. Those remain in their application repositories.
